# Original Twitch Bot Commands Archive

This directory contains the original pre-AI command implementations that were part of the initial version of DROSSBOT. These commands have been archived for nostalgic and reference purposes.

## Contents

- **executableCommands**: Original command implementations that were used before the refactoring
- **utilities**: Helper functions and utilities used by the original commands

These commands have been superseded by the more modular and flexible command system in the main codebase, but are preserved here as a reminder of the bot's origins and development history.

Feel free to reference these files if needed, but new functionality should be implemented using the current command system.
